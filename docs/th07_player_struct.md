# PCB Player struct — verified offset map (for Fork B, the P2 entity)

Grafting a second player (`src/coop/coop.c`, Fork B) means cloning and driving the
Player object. This is the field map gathered from `PCBdecomp.c`, to spare the next
session re-deriving it. Base of the single static player = **`0x004bdad8`**; struct
size = **`0xb7e78`** (`memcpy` size used by coop.c, = the chardata-ptr offset, below).

Offsets are from the player base. "src" = where verified. Build-specific to th07.exe
ver 1.00b (`35467EAF…E80CA`).

## Resources are NOT in the player struct
Lives/bombs/power/score live in the **score-manager resource struct** reached via the
singleton at `0x00626270` (`*(0x626270+8) == *(0x626278)`), NOT off the player. coop.c
field-swaps P2's bombs (`+0x68`) / power (`+0x7c`) there, with the anti-tamper checksum
(`+0xb0`) re-healed via `FUN_004012b0`. See coop.c's header comment — it's the
authoritative, runtime-validated account of the resource side.

## The `+0xb7e68` "spirit" pointer — relevant to resurrection
The state-3 handler mirrors the player's position into the object at `+0xb7e68` and
releases it on respawn. This is the death/respawn visual (the drifting spirit). th06's
co-op **resurrection** mechanic (hold focus + release shot near a dead partner in
PLAYER_STATE_SPIRIT for 90 frames → spend a life to revive) keys off exactly this
death/spirit state. When porting resurrection to PCB, this pointer + state 3/2 are the
hooks to investigate — and the death FSM below is where the revive injects.

## Death FSM & the resurrection seam (2026-06-12 overnight session, verified)

The player update `FUN_00441fb0` dispatches on the state byte `+0x2408`. State `2`
(dying) routes to the **death/respawn handler `FUN_00440cf0` @ `0x00440cf0`**
(def line 26731) — the seam for a "revive your partner" mechanic:

| Field / call | Meaning | PCBdecomp.c |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x16a08` | in state 2 = **deathbomb counter** — frames since the fatal hit; death COMMITS once `0x1d (29) < it` (the timer is state-multiplexed: invuln countdown in state 3, border countdown in state 4) | 26748 |
| `+0x23f8` | **respawn timer** — set on death, decremented each frame; hits 0 → respawn (restore control, drop power items) | 26778–26779 |
| `FUN_0042d5cd(-1)` | **lose a life** on death commit | 26763 |
| `FUN_0048b8a0()` | lives-remaining query; `>0` → respawn (`return 1`), `==0` → set game-over | 26761–26770 |
| `DAT_0062f64d = 1` | **game-over flag** (= coop.c `ADDR_GAMEOVER`) when out of lives | 26770 |
| `DAT_00626278 + 0x7c = 0` | **power reset** to 0 on respawn (confirms coop.c `RES_POWER` 0x7c) | 26787 / 26799 |
| `+0x930 / +0x934` | player X/Y reset to center on respawn (confirms `OFF_POS_X/Y`) | 26750–26751 |

**Resurrection design (mirrors th06's "hold focus + release shot near dead partner
for ~90 frames → spend a life to revive"):** while the partner is in state `2` inside
its deathbomb window (`+0x16a08 <= 29`), if the reviver holds the revive input for
the required frames, force the partner back to state `0`, clear `+0x16a08`/`+0x23f8`,
and **spend the REVIVER's life** (`FUN_0042d5cd(-1)` on the reviver) instead of
letting the partner's death commit. coop.c already intercepts the game-over flag for
P2 (ghost mode); resurrection replaces ghost mode by catching the partner *before*
the commit. The exact revive input, frame count, and whether revive should also work
mid-respawn (state 1/3 — i.e. from ghost mode, like the current F11) are tuning
calls for the live test.

> This section independently re-confirms coop.c's `OFF_STATE` (0x2408), `RES_POWER`
> (0x7c), `OFF_POS_X/Y` (0x930/0x934) and `ADDR_GAMEOVER` (0x62f64d).

## Shot / laser / bomb subsystem (2026-06-14 mapping pass)

The player's own shots live IN the player struct and are created/moved/drawn
param-relative (so P2's shots live in P2's clone — coop.c relies on this).

| Field | Meaning | src |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x2444` + i·`0x364` | shot slot array, 96 slots | coop.c `OFF_SHOTS` |
| slot `+0x34a` | u16 active flag (0 = free) | FUN_0043c700:25369 |
| slot `+0x34e` | i16 **laser-slot index** into the owner's laser table | FUN_0043c700:25351 |
| slot `+0x350` | i16 option index (which option fired it) | 25377 |
| slot `+0x1c0` | render flags (bit0xd = needs anm rebind) | 25352 |
| slot `+0x1c6` | anm rebind request (same field as any anm sprite obj) | 25353 |
| `+0x169d0` + idx·`0x10` | **laser-slot pointer table** (owner-side; the slot ptr a live laser is bound through — moving the slot orphans it, which broke MarisaB until coop.c kept P2 shots home) | 25090-25368, FUN_0043d2f0 |
| `+0x169cc` + idx·`0x10` | per-laser life/timer (`<1` ⇒ retire the slot) | 25357-25368 |
| `+0x169c4` + idx·`0x10` | per-laser sub-fields (countdown sentinel `0xfffffc19`) | 25358-25366 |
| `+0x16a20` | bombing flag (nonzero while a bomb runs) | OFF_BOMBING; 25356 |
| `+0x16a24` | bomb sub-state (selects the bomb update fn ptr) | (struct table above) |
| `+0x16a40` / `+0x16a48` | bomb update fn pointers (called indirectly) | (struct table above) |

- **`.sht` character shot config:** the per-character shot/bomb setup fns run at
  PCBdecomp.c 5932-7625 (one block per char×type; each clears `+0x16a20`). They
  install the shot-spawn callbacks + the bomb fn ptrs (`+0x16a40/48`) for the
  selected character — i.e. the data coop.c swaps when P2 picks a different char
  (`ApplyP2Selection`). The full `.sht` binary layout isn't mapped here.
- **Shot→enemy damage:** `FUN_0043d9e0(player, pos, size, &flag)` sweeps this shot
  array against an enemy box and returns the frame's damage — the function the enemy
  update calls (`th07_enemy_system.md` §3) and coop.c's boss-HP divisor targets.
- **8c (SakuyaA cross-char aim):** the aimed (non-homing) shot reads an aim target
  the enemy update fills keyed off the GLOBAL char id into static P1's block only;
  for a different-char P2=SakuyaA the source isn't per-player (coop.c mirrors P1's
  block each frame). A proper fix would give P2 its own aim-target fill — start from
  the enemy-update site that writes P1's aim block and the shot-spawn callback that
  reads it.

## Open / unverified
- Hitbox/graze radius offsets, focus-mode flag, and the power-shot level field are not
  yet located (collision uses the leaf primitives FUN_0043e260/6b0 that coop.c detours,
  which are param-relative — so P2 collision works without knowing the radius offset).
  The graze box is at `+0x960/+0x964/+0x96c/+0x970` (cherry doc §7c).
- ~~Whether `FUN_00441fb0`'s sub-calls pass `ECX = the cloned P2`~~ ✅ **RESOLVED
  (2026-06-12, disasm + in-game):** all sub-calls (incl. movement `FUN_0043ee50`)
  pass ECX = the saved player, so they DO drive the P2 clone (handoff §5d).
